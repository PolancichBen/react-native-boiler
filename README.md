# React Native Boiler
### Basic Boiler for React Native (Feel free to fork and clone)

### Important Notes:
In order for this project to work, some prerequisites are required.

First, if you would like to see your project build as an app on your phone, you will need to download the 'expo go' client from your respective app store. You can additionally download an [emulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/).

This project requires that you have node installed. See [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) docs

Next ensure you have the expo client installed globally. `npm i expo-cli -g`

After the initial setup is out of the way we can:
- npm i
- npm run start

After the metro bundler has finished building, use the expo-cli on your phone and scan the QR code. 
The build may take a moment for the first run. 

Side Note: I discovered that if you have a VPN on your phone, like I do, that will throw an error since it builds off the LAN.
